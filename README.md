```

## Customize Content
Edit files in `src/components/*` and section data arrays inside those components (e.g., skills, projects, timeline). Replace placeholder links (resume, social, demos) and the email in `Contact.jsx`.

## Notes
- Fonts: Poppins/Inter for headings, Open Sans for body (loaded in `index.html`).
- Tailwind config: `tailwind.config.cjs` with extended colors and shadows.
- Particles use `react-tsparticles`; you can swap to `@tsparticles/react` later if desired.
